                                        3rdparty modules
This folder contains third-party libraries for popular vision modules used in the extra modules,
including some common visual tag localization and decoding.

On Linux or Windows, all libraries are automatically detected by CMake scripts. To use these versions
of the libraries instead of the system ones, the BUILD_<library_name> CMake flags should be used (e.g.,
BUILD_APRILTAG for the apriltag library).
